# Consistency-Guided Temperature Scaling (CTS)
Official repository of our work on out-of-domain(OOD) calibration with **consistency-guided temperature scaling (CTS)**. \
Our paper, a collaborative effort between KAIST and Purdue University, will be published in **AAAI 2024** soon. \
This repository includes a quick summary of our method and a code implementation.

- **Title**: Consistency-Guided Temperature Scaling Using Style and Content Information for Out-of-Domain Calibration
- **Full paper link**: to be announced soon

> TL;DR: Our proposed CTS is a new method for **OOD calibration**, which is crucial for trustworthy AI systems but has been less explored so far. Motivated by our observation that over-confidence stemming from inconsistent predictions is the main obstacle to OOD calibration, our CTS takes consistencies into account in terms of two different aspects - **style and content** - which are the key components that can well-represent data samples in multi-domain settings.
